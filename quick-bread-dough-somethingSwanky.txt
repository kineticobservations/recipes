Ingredients

1 tbsp active dry yeast
1 cup warm water (think warm bath water)
1 tbsp sugar
1 tsp salt
2 tbsp olive or vegetable oil (use vegetable for sweet bread recipes)
2 1/2 cups flour

Instructions

Proof the yeast using the oil and sugar.
Mix the salt into the flour in a stand mixer bowl.
After the yeast has proofed, add the yeast mixture to the flour. Knead until a dough forms, and then continue kneading for an additional 5-6 minutes until dough is elastic.
Cover and let rise for about 10 minutes.
From this point you can roll it out and use it for any recipe calling for dough!
